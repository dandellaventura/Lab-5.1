# Lab-5.1
a) Redefine the class bankAccount  (below) to store a bank customer’s account number, owner’s full name, and balance. Your class should, besides many possible others, provide the following operations: retrieve the account number, retrieve the owner’s full name, retrieve the balance, deposit and withdraw money, and print account information.  b) Banks offer checking accounts. Derive the class checkingAccount from the class bankAccount (designed in part (a)). A customer with a checking account does not receive interest but pays service charges if the balance falls below the minimum balance ($100). Add member variables to store this additional information. In addition to the operations inherited from the base class, this class should provide the following operations: set minimum balance, retrieve minimum balance, set service charges, retrieve service charges, verify if the balance is less than the minimum balance, etc.  c) Write a program to test your classes. Do not hardcode inputs in your program (prompt the user for options).
